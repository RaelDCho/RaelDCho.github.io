**Challenge**: Try reversing this file? Can ya?
I forgot the password to this [file](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/272/ret). Please find it for me?

**Challenge Instructions**: Do the usual - download in your desired directory through `wget "https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/272/ret"`
Make it an executable using `chmod +x <file-name>`

**Solution**: After downloading the binary, I analysed what sort of file it was through the `file` command.
